Currently, deliver sends a pre determined string to server. server checks if it is the required message and then sends back acknowledgement which makes deliver output: a file trasnfer can start


Now, all those steps must occur. THEN:
    Deliver: 
        must open and read file. (DONE)
        
        must add contents to buffers of max_size 1000.
        do this repeatedly until end of file is reached. 
        
        Depending on how many buffers were filled, that will give total amount of packets that must be sent.

        Packets are sent in string form as such:  ->  packet = “3:2:10:foobar.txt:lo World!\n”
                                                                total amount of frags : current frag number : size of frag : name of file : data 
        
    Server:
        Recieves these packets and writes to a file.
